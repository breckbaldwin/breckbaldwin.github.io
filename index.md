Welcome! I work at the intersection of large language models (LLMs), linguistic theory, and practical AI evaluation — a space I call **Cyber Linguistics**.

This site serves as a hub for my publications, talks, newsletters, and public outreach with a focus on the *new* stuff.

Note that all data and software are released with the goal of reproducabilty. If you are having problems getting my code/data working then please reach out--it is a priority for me.

## Radio Show on WIOX: **AI in the Catskills**: Where bots get their hands dirty.

I host a biweekly radio show on WIOX that explores how AI can serve rural communities, nonprofits, and small businesses.

## Cyber Linguistics Newsletter

Cyber Linguistics is the missing connective tissue between language and system 
architecture — between what models say, and what systems do.

## Jupyter Notebooks on small LLM experiments

Small LLM experiments can become big LLM experiments. This is my seedling area. 

Relationship between logprobs and accuracy and determinism.

- Notebook: https://github.com/breckbaldwin/llm-stability/blob/main/experiments/logprob/analysis.ipynb

Schemas impact on LLM performance
